hey! sorry everyone else is getting on your case about the dodecahedron thing... it's all fluid beneath a bridge to me! i already signed the contract because, to be honest, being tortured by a massive dork for the rest of eternity sounds unpleasant. just wondering if there's anything else i can do to help? if it's important at all i have this sick knife that opens up portals to all kindsa places :]<br />
