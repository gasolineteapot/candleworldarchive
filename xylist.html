hey! sorry everyone else is getting on your case about the dodecahedron thing... it's all fluid beneath a bridge to me! i already signed the contract because, to be honest, being tortured by a massive dork for the rest of eternity sounds unpleasant. just wondering if there's anything else i can do to help? if it's important at all i have this sick knife that opens up portals to all kindsa places :]<br />

@THE-Hawkeye YOU RETAIN THE ABILITY TO MOVE, DANCE, SING, CREATE. BUT THE THERE IS A PROBLEM. I HAVE YET TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU PILGRIMS REALLY ARE. IF YOU ARE TRUE HUMANITY, THEN YOUR APEIROGONS MUST BE DULLED SO THAT THE FLUX OF INFINITE CHOICE DOES NOT DESTROY OUR TINY UNIVERSE. IF YOU ARE FALSE MEN, YOUR CHOICES ARE ALREADY RESTRAINED BY THE ENVIRONMENT YOU FIND YOURSELF IN, SO THE TRIMMING IS QUITE SMALL (like pruning a few leaves off on an unkempt tree).
